Currently prometheus does not do:
----------------------------------
>> raw log/event collection:
only dies aggregated time-series data if needed everything so a logging system is needed so no sort of every-user request or requests IDs ...etc


>> request tracking:
recommend zipkin for that 

>> "magic" anomaly detection:
No data analysis just a very explict querty


>> automatic horizontal scaling:

>> durable long-term storage:
its decoiupled but not yet fully integrated

>> user/auth management:
not integrated into prometheus 


- PromQL is great


Pull vs Push
-------------
- Exporters exist for each service that means it need to start separately for each service intended to be monitored including the physical nodes and later
  prometheus server will pull from these exporters.

- currently they favor this model instead of having one big exporeter for all running servcies, as it gets operational bottleneck, no isolation and would
  be forced to collect all data not selectively.

So they ended up installing one exporter per each service mysql, linux node, ...etc


>> Their HA model is different, as current prometheus isn't clustered, but it allows running two or more servers at once pull the same data while not 
   talking to each other as sort of replcating the most recent data with no cluster configurations or services running.
