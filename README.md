# prometheus-starter
## I assume this is running prometheus 1.6

This is just a hello-world promethus repo where you just need to run the node exporter to get receive some data.

This isn't using any monitoring dashboards like grafana, you would just need to access http://localhost:9100/metrics and click on graphs tab
